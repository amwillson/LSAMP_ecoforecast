# LSAMP_ecoforecast
Submissions to year 1 of the EFI-NEON Forecast Challenge

Submissions to the Ecological Forecast Challenge hosted by the Ecological Forecasting Network in collaboration with the National Ecological Observatory Network. Forecasts were produced by undergraduate students, Pricilla Ceja and Briana Ruiz in an 8-week Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Humboldt State University under the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program.  Prior to the REU, the students had no experience in producing ecological forecasts.  Students were mentored by Alyssa Willson and Jason McLachlan (University of Notre Dame).
