DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20004.001

Name: Barometric pressure above water on-buoy

Description: Barometric pressure, available as one-minute instantaneous measurements and thirty-minute averages for both station pressure and pressure reduced to sea level. Observations are made on the meteorology station on the buoy in lakes and rivers.

NEON Science Team Supplier: AIS

Abstract: Barometric pressure on buoys is measured every minute and is reported as 1-minute instantaneous measurements and 30-minute mean values. Other than the data collection frequency, this data product has the same data streams and processing as barometric pressure measured at aquatic met stations.

Latency:
Data collected in any given month are published during the second full week of the following month.

Brief Design Description: The buoys are comprised of sensor sets which measure meteorological parameters over a water surface along with submerged sensors that measure physical and chemical parameters of the water body. Some of these sensors are unique to the buoy subsystem and others are shared with other NEON subsystems, such as the wadeable stream sensor sets or terrestrial towers. Due to power, space, and data storage constraints on the buoy, the configuration of sensors deployed on a buoy may be different than those in other parts of NEON.

Brief Study Area Description: Buoys will be deployed at allÂ lake and large river sites within NEON.

Sensor(s): Vaisala - BAROCAP Digital Barometer PTB330

Keywords: lakes, meteorological station, atmospheric pressure, buoy, metabolism, met station, rivers, aquatic, barometric pressure

FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS
-----------------------

NEON data files are named using a series of component abbreviations separated by periods. File naming conventions for NEON data files differ between NEON science teams. A file will have the same name whether it is accessed via the data portal or the API.

NEON instrumented systems (IS) data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.HOR.VER.TMI.DESC.YYYY-MM.PKGTYPE.GENTIME.csv

The definitions of component abbreviations are below. See NEON.DOC.002651: NEON Data Product Numbering Convention, located at http://data.neonscience.org/documents for more information.

General conventions, used for all data products:
   NEON: denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI.

   DOM: a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20).

CHANGE LOG
----------

Issue Date: 2021-01-14
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or eliminated maintenance activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability and/or quality may be negatively impacted during this time, and extra scrutiny of data is advised.

The annual refresh of sensors and data acquisition systems (DAS) also did not occur according to the typical 1-year schedule for many sites. The annual refresh is where freshly calibrated and verified sensors and DAS replace the units that have been deployed for a year. While NEON is working towards implementing automated drift estimations/corrections on calibrated data products and flagging related to sensors that fall outside the policy for calibration frequency, this had not been implemented at the time of COVID impacts. 

The following sites had annual refreshes canceled in 2020 and will likely go up to two years of deployment for their sensors:
BLWA (due May 2020)
TOMB (due May 2020)

Issue Date: 2021-02-23
Issue: Following the planned seasonal removal of the buoy sensors, data processing continued to run producing files containing only flags. The files containing only flags have been published for the months of 11/2020 and 12/2020.
       Date Range: 2020-11-01 to 2020-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: PRPO (HOR.VER: 103.100); PRLA (HOR.VER: 103.100); LIRO (HOR.VER: 103.100); CRAM (HOR.VER: 103.100)
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: 

Issue Date: 2020-03-26
Issue: The alpha and beta quality metric multipliers used for computing the final quality flag were swapped in processing. The final quality flag is raised when alphaQM*m + betaQM*n >= 20%. The multiplier m should be set to 2 and n should be set to 1, but these values were swapped, making it slightly harder to raise the final quality flag. These multipliers were corrected in data produced after the resolution date. Data prior to the resolution date will be reprocessed prior to the first NEON data release. An additional changelog comment will be entered at that time.
       Date Range: 2020-01-08 to 2020-01-08
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2020-06-10
Resolution: 2020-01-08: Processing code updated.
2020-06-10: All data reprocessed with corrected algorithm.

Issue Date: 2020-06-10
Issue: All data were reprocessed with the most recent algorithms, quality control thresholds, and/or other metadata to improve overall data coverage and quality. Notes have been added to the logs of previously identified issues that have been corrected.
       Date Range: 2013-01-01 to 2020-06-10
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2020-06-10
Resolution: 

Issue Date: 2020-03-12
Issue: Buoy moved significantly down river while streaming data.
       Date Range: 2019-11-01 to 2019-11-03
       Location(s) Affected: TOMB (HOR.VER: 103.100)
Resolution Date: 2019-11-03
Resolution: Buoy stopped transmitting data

Issue Date: 2019-07-17
Issue: Incorrect calculations were applied to previously published data for the buoy station pressure corrected to sea level (corPres). For sites with both an inlet and outlet, when only one of inlet or outlet was available, the elevation was erroneously divided by two, resulting in incorrect corPres. When neither was available, the corPres term was still calculated using an elevation of 0.7 m.
       Date Range: 2018-01-01 to 2019-06-30
       Location(s) Affected: All locations
Resolution Date: 2019-07-17
Resolution: The calculation code was modified to fix corPres calculations and all data were reprocessed. The code has been modified to: (1) not divide the surface water elevation by two when only one of the inlet or outlet data streams are available, and (2) produce no corPres output when neither are available.

Issue Date: 2019-06-13
Issue: The quality flags for corPresDewPtQF and corPresTempQF outputs were erroneously set.
       Date Range: 2018-01-01 to 2019-05-31
       Location(s) Affected: All locations.
Resolution Date: 2019-06-13
Resolution: The code was changed to resolve this issue and data were reprocessed.  Fewer outputs for corPres are expected to be flagged by corPresDewPtQF, corPresTempQF, and corPresFinalQF due to this change.

Issue Date: 2019-02-19
Issue: Incorrect calibration information was applied to data.
       Date Range: 2018-01-01 to 2018-10-31
       Location(s) Affected: All locations.
Resolution Date: 2019-02-19
Resolution: Data reprocessed with correct calibration information.

DATA QUALITY AND VERSIONING
---------------------------

The data contained in this file are considered provisional. Updates to the data, QA/QC and/or processing algorithms over time will occur on an as-needed basis.  Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs.  Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed. 
 
Starting in 2020 or earlier, NEON will begin to offer static versions of each data product, annotated with a globally unique identifier. Versioned IS and OS data will be produced by reprocessing each IS and OS data product from the beginning of the data collection period to approximately 12-18 months prior to the reprocessing date (to allow for calibration checks, return of external lab data, etc.). The reprocessing step will use the most recent QA/QC methods and processing algorithms. Versioned AOP data will be produced by reprocessing the entire AOP archive as advances in algorithms and processing technology are incorporated. This will typically occur in the northern winter months, between flight season peaks, and will be on the order of every 3 to 5 years in frequency.
